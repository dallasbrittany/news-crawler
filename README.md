# news-crawler

Very simple usage of `fundus` for news crawling.

- The `examples` folder contains examples from the fundus README.
- The `searches` folder contains (simple) custom searches

> NOTE: Fundus' filters work inversely to Python's built-in filter. A filter in Fundus describes what is filtered out and not what's kept. If a filter returns True on a specific element the element will be dropped.
